[The issue with monorepos](https://www.squash.io/the-issue-with-monorepos/)
- VirtualFileSystem that allows access to only a portion of the repo
- code search and discovery speed
- tight coupling/blurry separation of responsibilities

Upsides?
- single source of truth
- easier dependency management
- code sharing/collaboration
- code quality/enforcing standards
